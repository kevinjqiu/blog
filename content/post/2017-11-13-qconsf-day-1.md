The big day has finally arrived. I'm here at QCon, a conference I have been tracking for a long time almost since the beginning of my career. Now, almost 10 years after, thanks to [my employer](https://points.com), I'm finally able to attend one in person!

In the next couple of blog posts, I'm going to recap these three talk-packed days and record my learnings here.

# Key Note - How to make a spaceship (Julian Guthrie, Dan Kreigh)

The keynote is given by Julian Guthrie and Dan Kreigh who together wrote a book [How to make a spaceship](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318656/how-to-make-a-spaceship-by-julian-guthrie/9781101980491/). This is a story about Peter Diamandis and Burt Rutan's journey to build SpaceShipOne which pioneered the private space flight industry. It's a message about passion and enterpreneurship, thinking big and defying convention. I think it's a fairly good start to the conference with a pretty solid inspirational message.

# Vision & Strategy - Epiphanies of a Netflix Leader (Josh Evans)

The first talk I attended was about vision and strategy by Josh Evans, a former Netflix manager. I enjoyed the talk very much. It provided great information on having a vision and thinking strategically, which allowed Netflix to become such a dominant force in the market.

## Notes

### Think strategically:
- Have a vision
- Vision brings clarity and focus
- Be a mountain climber, do not optimize for local optima, instead, look for global optima aka "the mountain".

### Attitude:
- Begin with end in mind
- Be proactive
- Prioritization along urgency-importance axis (4 quadrants)

### Business Strategy
A route to continuing *power* in significant markets - Hamilton Helmer

*Power* brings both *Benefit* and *Barrier* - Benefit for yourself and barrier for your competitors.

### Seven Powers
- Scale economies (e.g., Amazon)
- Network economies (e.g., LinkedIn)
- Counter-positioning (e.g., Vanguard)
- Switching Costs (e.g., iTunes)
- Branding (e.g., Tiffany)
- Cornered Resources (e.g., Patents, Pixar)
- Process Power (e.g., Toyota)

# The Anatomy of a Distributed System (Tyler McMullen)

Tyler McMullen is the CTO of Fastly. At work I have come in contact with distributed system on a daily basis but have not yet been fully exposed to the aspects of a distributed system, so this is a very informative session for me personally.

## Notes

### Concepts
- cluster membership
- fault detection
- rendesvous hashing
- gossip
- CRDT

### Problems
A health check service (multi-instance) that run in data centres that check customer origins and make sure the load balancing does not route requests to an original that's down.

Cannot check all origins all the time - need to assign certain origins to certain health check services => distributed systems problem.

Total ordering => Too strong consistency for this system

In this system, it needs to be able to make forward progress => eventual consistency

### Ownership and Rendesvous hashing
```
h(S, O) = W
```
h = hash function
S = the service nodes
O = origin
W = weight

output:
```
priorities(O1) = [S2, S3, S1, S4, ...]
```

### Failure Detection SWIM (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership)
1 -> 3 up?
if 3 is not up, 1 -> 2, 1 -> 4: is 3 up?

Don't DIY, use: hashicorp memberlist

### Gossip for communication


### Convergence

Do not need total ordering (for strong consistency).
Only need partial ordering (account for concurrent events or events with no causal relationships).
*Lattices* - two lattices can always be merged - can be used to model causality and apply partial ordering - use a *version vector*.

#### Delta-state CRDT Map

Conflict-free Replicated Data Type. There's a talk on Day 3 which delves a little bit deeper into this topic.

Delta lattice are CRDT that are sent to the nodes of the cluster to bring consistency to the cluster.

Paper: delta-CRDTs: Making delta-CRDTs delta-based

### Why distributed systems?

Single System Image
- Present a single face to the end user
- System is linearizable

but the real world is more in tune with partial ordering.
