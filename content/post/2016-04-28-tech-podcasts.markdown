As software developers, we need to always keep learning and keep ourselves up-to-date with what's happening in the industry. Listening to podcasts is a great way to do so for myself since I have a 2-hour commute every day. In this blog post I'm going to review software engineering podcasts that I frequently listen to and hopefully this post will be remotely useful to anyone looking for software podcasts.

I'm not affiliated with any of the podcasts. Any comments I have on the podcasts are highly subjective. I'm mostly a backend web developer interested in devops, distributed systems and scalability, so I don't subscribe to podcasts that are dedicated to iOS/Android development.

Software Engineering Daily
==========================

**Link:** [http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)

**Frequency:** everyday

This has been a revelation for me since I discovered it at the end of last year (2015). It brings an episode of in-depth interview every day without fail, which speaks volume to the host [Jeff Meyerson](https://twitter.com/the_prion)'s passion for technology. The topics are wide-ranged, from distributed systems to operations (e.g., production monitoring) tobig data and everything in between. It's very-well prepared and the guests are usually highly knowledgable of the subject.

I highly recommend this podcast.

Software Engineering Radio
==========================
