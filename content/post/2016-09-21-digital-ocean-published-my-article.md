[Digital Ocean](www.digitalocean.com) just published my article on [How to setup Review Ninja on a Digital Ocean droplet using docker-machine and CoreOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-self-host-reviewninja-on-digitalocean-using-docker-and-coreos).

They have high standard for their articles, e.g., every step has to be crystal clear and assume the audience is blank slate. Their editors are technical. The editor I was assigned to was Brian Hogan who wrote [the tmux book](https://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux) which I have read and loved a few years back. How cool was that! All in all, a good experience and I highly recommend writing for them if you have time.
