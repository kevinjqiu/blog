* I'm a software engineer living in the [Greater Toronto Area, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan).
* I graduated with distinction from [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), Computer Science program.
* My favourite programming language is [Python](http://www.python.org) while I admire the beauty of [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and [Scala](http://scala-lang.org).
* I also write [Go](http://golang.org), some Ruby and JavaScript (of course).
* I love [docker](http://docker.io) and everything devops.
* I use console [vim](http://vim.org) with [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) for almost all of my coding; [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) at home and [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) at work.
* Outside of computers, I also like world history, geography and piano.
